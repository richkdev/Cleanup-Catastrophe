# change log lol

## v.ALPHA.1.0.0 - the awesome update

- restructured files + added new files
- came up with a sick new logo
- made music in beepbox, still needs a lot of polish
- finally picked up OOP, and used it for the sprites (dirty sprites)
- fixed how PNGs are displayed (import after display so it can convert alpha) & rendered on the screen (images not upscaled anymore, window is upscaled using SCALED flag)
- added a lot of flags to the pygame screen
- added discord rich presence using pypresence
- added opengl context (uses GPU instead of CPU) so my laptop wont get fried for the 412th time
- tried out shaders using moderngl (thanks dafluffypotato & jingshing, i credited y'all in the readme)
- tried to export using pyinstaller, it kind of works (will fix spec file later)
- removed herobrine (fr)

**NOTE:** really sorry this update took long, school has been up my ass for the past few months

i should name the next update as "the extra awesome update"

## v.ALPHA.0.5.0 - yes

- made 'the base' of the game (you get the jizz)
- really bad
