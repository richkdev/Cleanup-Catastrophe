**_Cleanup Catastrophe!_**  is an educational free-to-play indie game developed by [Richmond Kleinson](https://richkdev.itch.io) that aims to raise awareness about the issue of plastic pollution in the ocean among young minds.

Inspired by the vibrant colors of the SEGA Genesis home console, the game introduces you to a simple user interface as you clean various trash items scattered throughout the ocean floor.

## GAMEPLAY
Play as  **Paul Fischer**  (_Budi Sugiyono Cahyadi_), your ordinary local fisherman, whose life had changed when tasked by the goddess of water,  _Nyi Roro Kidul_, to clean up the waters that her kingdom had inhibited long ago.
