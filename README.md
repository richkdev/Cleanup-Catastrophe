## ABOUT

**_Cleanup Catastrophe!_**  is an educational free-to-play indie game that aims to raise awareness about the issue of plastic pollution in the ocean among young minds. Inspired by the vibrant colors of the SEGA Genesis home console, our game introduces the player to a simple user interface as you clean various trash items scattered throughout the ocean floor. Through this game, we hope to educate our players the importance of effective solid waste management, and how to apply them in their daily lives.
